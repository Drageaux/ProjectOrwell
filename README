5. Add a build task by clicking the dropdown in the top-right and selecting "Edit Configurations"
6. Click the green + button
7. Select "SBT Task"
8. Name the task anything you like
9. Under "task" write "run"
10. Remove "Make" from the list
11. Select "Single Instance"
12. Select "Okay"

YOU DID IT!

Setup Endpoint HTTP 8080

In VM:
SSH into the VM

Install git on VM
sudo apt-get install git

Clone latest project from repository
git clone https://github.com/Drageaux/ProjectOrwell.git

Install Java 8 on VM
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java -y
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default

Run activator - Must be in directory ProjectOrwell/
